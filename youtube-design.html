        <h1 class="screenshot1_text">Redesigned With a Minimal<br>and Modern Aesthetic</h1>
        <p class="screenshot1_subtext">The design uses depth as not only a way to show contrast,<br>but also as a means of giving the viewer more comfort when viewing.<br> The layout remains familiar yet removes much of the bloat<br>modern Youtube has gained. </p>

        <h1 class="screenshot2_text">Reimagined Play Bar</h1>
        <p class="screenshot2_subtext">The playbar is a tool, something used to accomplish a task. To ensure that it never stands<br>in the way of that task it is essential that the playbar contrasts well against the currently playing video.<br>By adding depth and shadows alongside blur, it amplifies the contrast viewed ensuring you will always be able<br>to see the controls.</p>

        <h1 class="screenshot3_text">Putting the "You"<br>Back In Youtube</h1>
        <p class="screenshot3_subtext">Youtube through its many identity shifts through time has lost what made it special,<br>while this may be a more underlying issue, I believe user centric design goes a long way in making<br>the experience feel more personal and not just simply personalized. Having your account shown<br>up front at all times re-affirms the fact it is YOUR experience. </p>

        <h1 class="screenshot4_text">Changing The Way<br>Recommendations Are Handled</h1>
        <p class="screenshot4_subtext">Perhaps the largest change in the user experience of Youtube is how you are able to<br>sort recommendations. Many times it is difficult to find something to watch on the homepage, having extra<br>filters fixes this issue. Not only being able to sort by Topics & Categories it allows<br>you to choose what form that content is in the form of tabs. Each media format is seperated making<br>sure your feed isn't cluttered enabling you to find a video more effectively.</p>
